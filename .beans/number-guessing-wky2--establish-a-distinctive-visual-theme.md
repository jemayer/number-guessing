Replace the generic purple-blue gradient + centered card look with something that has actual personality. The current aesthetic screams "AI-generated demo app."

## Ideas to explore

- A cohesive color palette that ties into the hot/cold game mechanic (warm tones vs cool tones as a design language)
- Typography with more character — the system font stack is fine functionally but contributes to the generic feel
- Background treatment that's more than just a gradient — could be subtle, textured, or reactive
- Consider using the `frontend-design` skill to generate options

## Acceptance criteria

- The game has a recognizable visual identity you wouldn't confuse with a generic template
- Dark and light themes both feel intentional, not just "invert the colors"
- Still vanilla CSS, no frameworks
