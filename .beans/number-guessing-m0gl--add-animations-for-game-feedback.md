Add visual animations to make the game feel more responsive and fun.

Animations:
- Shake the input on wrong guess (higher/lower)
- Confetti or celebration effect on win
- Subtle pulse or highlight when a new record is set
- Smooth transitions for showing/hiding elements (win message, name prompt)

Implementation:
- Use CSS animations/keyframes where possible (no JS libraries)
- Keep animations short and snappy (not distracting)
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion for accessibility
