The hot/cold mechanic is the most interesting part of the game, but the heat bar is currently an easy-to-miss 8px strip. It should be a dramatic, central visual element.

## Ideas to explore

- Make it taller and more prominent in the layout hierarchy
- Add a glow or ambient effect that intensifies as you get warmer
- Could the background or environment itself respond to warmth (e.g., subtle color shifts)
- Consider a thermometer or gauge metaphor instead of a flat bar
- The win flash (green pulse) could be more celebratory

## Acceptance criteria

- The heat bar is visually prominent and immediately draws the eye
- Warmth/coolness is communicated through more than just bar width (color, glow, animation, etc.)
- The transition between states feels smooth and satisfying
