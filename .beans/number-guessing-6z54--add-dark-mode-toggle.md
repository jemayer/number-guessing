Add a dark mode option with preference persistence.

Requirements:
- Toggle button/switch in the UI (e.g., top corner)
- Dark color scheme for all elements (background, card, inputs, buttons, text)
- Respect system preference (prefers-color-scheme) as default
- Store user's choice in localStorage (override system preference)
- Smooth transition when switching themes
- Ensure sufficient contrast in both modes
